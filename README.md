## Machine Learning Model Building Project

In the following notebooks, I will take you through a practical example of each one of the steps in the Machine Learning model building pipeline that I learned throughout my experience and analyzing many kaggle notebooks. There will be a notebook for each one of the Machine Learning Pipeline steps:

1. Data Analysis
2. Feature Engineering
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Building

We will use the house price dataset available on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). See below for more details.

## Predicting Sale Price of Houses

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of residential houses. 

### Why is this important? 

Predicting house prices is useful to identify fruitful investments, or to determine whether the price advertised for a house is over or underestimated, before making a buying judgment.

### What is the objective of the machine learning model?

We aim to minimise the difference between the real price, and the estimated price by our model. We will evaluate model performance using the mean squared error (mse) and the root squared of the mean squared error (rmse).

### How do I download the dataset?
